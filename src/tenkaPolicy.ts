/**
 * A SENSIBLE RANDOM PLAYER: the computer seat, and what a test plays whole
 * games out with.
 *
 * Choosing uniformly among every move offered would never end a game of
 * Tenka: a player
 * who ends their attack at random, places one army at a time on a random
 * territory and marches armies back and forth plays for ever, as a person
 * never would. So this plays at random among the moves a person might make
 * — trade when it can, pile the turn's armies onto one border (its
 * strongest, mostly), attack only with the odds (more armies than the
 * defender, and three at least), the widest margin first, each attack
 * thrown until it is decided,
 * advance everything after a win, and fortify from behind the lines to the
 * front — which is enough for games to end by conquest as they do at a real
 * table, with the rounds' count behind it for the ones that do not.
