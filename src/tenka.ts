/**
 * TENKA 天下: THE RULES, and nothing else — the classic game of world
 * conquest, for two to six players.
 *
 * Pure, as the engine is: `playTenka` returns a new game and leaves the one it
 * was given untouched, and nothing here draws, keeps or asks anything. A game
 * is its table and its moves; every die is drawn from its own seeded random
 * (`tenkaDice.ts`), so the same moves always make the same world
 * (`replayTenka`, `tenkaKeep.ts`).
 *
 * A TURN: reinforce (one army for every three territories, at least three,
 * each continent held whole adding its bonus, and a set of cards traded in
 * adding more — five cards in hand must be traded before placing — placed one
 * at a time or all the rest at once, so any spread is a run of those); attack as
 * often as you like, a neighbour at a time, up to three dice against up to
 * two; take a territory and move in at least as many armies as dice rolled;
 * then one fortifying move between two of your own connected territories, or
 * none. A turn that took a territory ends with a card. Knock a player out and
 * their cards are yours — six or more, and you trade at once.
